 Ludum Dare 46 Game

This repository contains all the files for my entry to the Ludum Dare 46 compo themed "Keep it Alive".

The game is about a lost astronaut, Commander Sally, who suffered an accident when trying to repair her shuttle.

Gameplay

- Commander Sally's objective is to keep-it-alive: her sanity, her fuel to maneuver and her hope to stay alive!
- Player controls Sally's limited propeller can. The system is blocked and she's not spinning, so she can only move in one axis (Y).
- By clicking bellow Sally, she's propelled upwards. Click above and she'll be propelled downwards.
- Right click creates a quick impulse at extra propeller cost.

This repository will no longer be updated, but the project will continue as open source in a fork.

Thanks for reading, playing and providing feedback!

Note: if you are a recruiter that arrived at my gitHub, consider the code is a mess! Of course, it was made in 48hs.
